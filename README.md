I am Guilherme, a computer engineer fascinated with math, theorem provers, type theory, and logic.
I like to prove theorems in Agda, Lean, Idris, and KeY.
I am doing my PhD at Chalmers University, improving the SoldiKeY theorem prover.
And after studying cubical type theory and theorem provers,
I decided to create this [blog](https://guilhermehas.github.io/) to share my ideas and thoughts.
